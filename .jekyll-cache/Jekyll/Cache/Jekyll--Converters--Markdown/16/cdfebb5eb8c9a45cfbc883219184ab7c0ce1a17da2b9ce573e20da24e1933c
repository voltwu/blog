</blockquote>

<p>I have grown a strong interest in programming a lot of years ago. No doubts, Interest is the best teacher, I have been benefitted from the best teacher when I created a strong learning attraction. the sight of study from morning until night appears clearly in my head. As a reword of my study hard in school, I favorably became a programmer at a little company with less than 5 people in October 2017.</p>

<p>I always dreaming become a master in programming, even though I‚Äôm lacking a lot of materials. this hope light will lead me forwards far away. This tough road full of difficulties, but I will insist on. sometimes, a moment or two, I wanted to give up, but the power of strong hope pulled me back immediately. I still not reach the shore of hope, never lose energy, never lose hope.</p>

<p>I am a dream chaser as you are.</p>
