When I was in university, I favored Programming, I wanted to become a programmer, a good, passionate, and enthusiastic programmer. Because I want to build something, something is cool, something really matters, something can change the world. I enjoy the programming process, produce stability and reliability codes really makes me proud and confident. The charming of coding constantly attracts me, eager to learn something new in my interesting area is whole my life need to do. I will never lose energy.

motto:
>Nothing is impossible, the word itself says:"I am possible!" __ Audrey Hepburn

I always dreaming to become a master in programming, even though I'm lacking a lot of materials. The hope light will lead me forwards far away. This tough road full of difficulties, but I will insist on. 

I am a dream chaser as you are.
