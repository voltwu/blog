Programming is an interesting work seems to me. I expect to produce stability and reliability code. the charming of coding attracts constantly me. most of my knowledge I get is through self-study. Eager to learn something new in my interesting area is whole my life need to do. I will never lose energy.
motto:

>Nothing is impossible, the word itself says:"I am possible!" __ Audrey Hepburn

I have grown a strong interest in programming a lot of years ago. No doubts, Interest is the best teacher, I have been benefitted from the best teacher when I created a strong learning attraction. the sight of study from morning until night appears clearly in my head. As a reword of my study hard in school, I favorably became a programmer in [Chengdu][1]. 

I always dreaming become a master in programming, even though I'm lacking a lot of materials. this hope light will lead me forwards far away. This tough road full of difficulties, but I will insist on. sometimes, a moment or two, I wanted to give up, but the power of strong hope pulled me back immediately. I still not reach the shore of hope, never lose energy, never lose hope.

I am a dream chaser as you are.
